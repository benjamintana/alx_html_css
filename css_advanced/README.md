# ðŸ˜„ Smile School â€” A beginner-friendly HTML project built to practice semantic structure and layout design. This page includes a hero banner, tutor profiles, tutorial videos with ratings, testimonials, membership benefits, and an FAQ section. Designed using clean HTML with accessibility in mind, it uses semantic tags like `<section>`, `<figure>`, and proper `alt` attributes. To run the project, simply clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser. Ideal for learning web structure, layout planning, and foundational development skills.
